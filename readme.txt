This plugin lets you customize plenty of things on the default comment forms.

== Description ==

The Comment Form plugin enables you to customize the WordPress comment form right from your dashboard.

You can find the settings page under `Comments > Comment Form` in the dashboard.

Features:

* hide the url field (where commenters can leave their urls)
* hide the message that emails are not published and which fields are required
* hide the text about which html tags are allowed
* insert custom text before the form
* insert custom text after the form

I am open to your suggestions for more features here or the [github repository](https://github.com/webgilde/comment-form)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the settings page under `Comments > Comment Form` to customize the form

== Screenshots ==

1. Comment form before and after applying some of the plugin options

== Important Notes ==

* the plugin works only, if your theme uses the standard WordPress comment form function
* options that where submitted with the `comment_form` function in your template overwrite most of the plugin functions
